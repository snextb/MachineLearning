 + ML addresses 
    + framing the problem
    + preparing the data
    + experimenting
    + evaluating the model
        + recall
        + precision
        +  F1 score
        +   cross-entropy


 ML practitioners train models using 
 + different architectures
    + CNNs, or convolutional neural networks -  used for image classification, object detection, and recommender systems
    + RNNs or recurrent neural networks -  for sequence modeling, next word prediction, translating sounds to words and human language translation. 
    + Sorting and clustering architectures - for anomaly detection, and pattern recognition.
    + GANS, or generative adversarial networks - for anomaly detection, pattern recognition, cybersecurity, self-driving cars, and reinforced learning.
 + input datasets
    +  numerical data sets
    +  bivariate data sets
    +  multivariate data sets
    +  categorical data sets
    +  correlation data sets
 + hyperparameters
    + learning rate
    + number of layers
    + num_estimators
    +  max_depth. 
 + hardware
    + CPUs
    + GPUs
    + TPUs
